# Retrospective Guide

Learn proven retrospective formats and techniques to drive continuous improvement for teams and individuals.

## When to Use This Skill

- Planning a sprint or project retrospective
- Conducting personal weekly/monthly reflections
- Post-mortem after incidents or releases
- Team health checks and improvement discussions
- Onboarding new team members to retro practices

## Core Concepts

### 1. Psychological Safety First

A successful retrospective requires trust and openness.

**Key Principles:**
- No blame - focus on systems, not individuals
- What's said in retro stays in retro
- All perspectives are valid and welcomed
- Silence is okay - give people time to think

### 2. The Retrospective Prime Directive

> "Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand."
> — Norm Kerth

## Popular Formats

### Format 1: Start / Stop / Continue

Simple and effective for regular sprints.

| Category | Question |
|----------|----------|
| **Start** | What should we begin doing? |
| **Stop** | What should we stop doing? |
| **Continue** | What's working well that we should keep? |

### Format 2: 4Ls (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For)

Great for learning-focused teams.

- **Liked**: What did you enjoy?
- **Learned**: What new things did you discover?
- **Lacked**: What was missing or insufficient?
- **Longed For**: What do you wish you had?

### Format 3: Sailboat

Visual and engaging metaphor.

```
        🎯 Island (Goals)
           /
    💨 Wind -----> ⛵ -----> 🪨 Rocks (Risks)
   (Helping)        |
                    |
                  ⚓ Anchor (Slowing us down)
```

### Format 4: Mad / Sad / Glad

Emotion-based for team bonding.

- 😠 **Mad**: What frustrated you?
- 😢 **Sad**: What disappointed you?
- 😊 **Glad**: What made you happy?

## Best Practices

### Before the Retrospective
1. Set a clear timebox (45-90 minutes)
2. Prepare the format and questions
3. Send a pre-retro survey if helpful
4. Ensure everyone can attend

### During the Retrospective
1. Review previous action items first
2. Give individual thinking time before sharing
3. Group similar items together
4. Vote to prioritize (dot voting works well)
5. Assign owners to action items

### After the Retrospective
1. Share summary with the team
2. Track action items visibly
3. Follow up on progress
4. Celebrate completed improvements

## Action Item Formula

Good action items are **SMART**:

```
[WHO] will [DO WHAT] by [WHEN] to achieve [OUTCOME]

Example:
"Sarah will set up automated testing for the API
by next Friday to reduce manual QA time by 50%"
```

## Common Pitfalls

- **No follow-through**: Action items are created but never completed
  - Solution: Review previous items at start of each retro

- **Same issues every time**: Problems repeat without resolution
  - Solution: Dig into root causes, not symptoms

- **Blame culture**: People afraid to share honestly
  - Solution: Reinforce Prime Directive, lead by example

- **Too many action items**: Overwhelming and nothing gets done
  - Solution: Limit to 2-3 high-impact items per retro
